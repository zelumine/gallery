# gallery
Image gallery made with Bootstrap 4 and [Lightbox](https://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/).

I wanted to play a little with Bootstrap 4 because I mostly know Boostrap 3.
I added the Lightbox script because I wanted to be able to enlarge the pictures when you click on it, in a nice way.

The pictures are mine, I took them between 2016 and 2018 in Canada.
